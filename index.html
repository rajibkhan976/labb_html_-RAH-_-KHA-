		My name is Rajib Hossain Khan. I am from Bangladesh. I am 30 years of old. I came to Sweden on
		2017 for studying master programme in 'Information Systems' at Linnaeus University. Before moving
		to Sweden I worked as a web developer for 7 months in my homeland as I had a diploma on web development.
		Since the educational system in Sweden is different from my country a diploma was not enough to
		get admission at the master programme in programming at a Swedish university. So, I was looking
		for an opportunity to study programming in Sweden. Then I came to know about EC Utbildning and applied
		for the frontend development course. I got admission in 2018 and started my education. 
		In the beginning it was a bit hard becasue the medium of instruction is Swedish. I was also studying
		Swedish at that time. So, my previous knowledge and little knowledge of Swedish helped me to
		pass all the courses in the first two semesters. Then EC Utbildning started the Java programme 
		from the next year. As a worked with PHP before, I thought that I can try to learn Java also.
		So, I took admission in the Java programme. So, in future I would like to work as a fullstack
		developer. In my spare time I watch movies, hang out with my friends and families, etc.
